# NusantAR
NusantAR is an application that allows users to experience Indonesian folktales through Augmented Reality (AR) technology. The way NusantAR works is by having the user scan a specially modified storybook. When scanned with their device, users can see vivid visual representations of the story, made more immersive with the help of augmented reality.
